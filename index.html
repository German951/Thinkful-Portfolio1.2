      <h3> Hello, I'm German Thinkful!!</h3>
   <br> 
      <p>I am a Software Engineer in the making, living in Moreno Valley, CA</p>
    
      <p>Here are a few of my current interests:</p>
    <uo>
      <li>I love fashion and see it as an extension of my personality.</li>
      <li>Finding new music, to me, is like striking oil.</li>
      <li>Brain storming new ideas for web development.</li>
    </uo>
    <p>Please take a look at my website!</p>

    <h4>About German</h4>
    <p>Before I started at Thinkful, I was working in a cold storage warehouse for the last 6 years, but alwyas had knack for technology. </p>
    <p>That's when I decided to try a different approach into the fashion industry and try out web development. Without a great website to support a brand, it can be very hard to get your name out.</p>
    <p>So with that said I would love to collaborate with genuine people with similar interest to start up the next ground breaking site.</p>
